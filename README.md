# Donation Platform

## Agenda: 
Provide a platform where people can donate or receive resources using **donor-recipient model**.

## Context:
In the nonprofit sector, non-profits should prioritize establishing strong relationships with donors and ensuring that the resources received are used effectively to fulfill the organization's mission and make a meaningful difference in the community. In this case, there is a lack of transparency on how the resources received are used effectively. And it is difficult to keep the accountability and trust of donors. 

The **donor-recipient model** is fundamental to the functioning of organizations. It involves the relationship between individuals or entities providing financial support (*donors*) and those receiving the support (*recipients*), typically in the form of donations or grants. The donor-recipient model is built on trust, transparency, and accountability.

To solve the common problems in non-profit sector, we come up with an idea to **maintain a community based donation platform**.

Benefits of a **community based donation platform**.
  * Increased efficiency: Reduces all intermediate transactions and time taken to complete the process.
  * Transparent and trusted transactions: It is very transparent on the resources needed and fulfillment of the requirement. Community gives the trust to the donor, on decision making. 
  * Enhanced community engagement: Fosters a sense of ownership, empowers community members, and ensures that initiatives are tailored to the specific needs and preferences of the communities they serve.
  * Improved decision-making: More responsive and context-specific decisions, as those closer to the ground often have a better understanding of local needs and dynamics.
  * Flexibility and Adaptability: Adaptable to changing circumstances and local contexts, and respond quickly to emerging needs.
